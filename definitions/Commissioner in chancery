A lawyer appointed by the chief circuit court judge who conducts evidentiary hearings and makes factual findings in circuit court cases referred to him by the circuit court judge who is conducting the trial. The Commissioner in Chancery collects a fee for his services. His findings of fact are subject to challenge before the circuit court judge through the noting of exceptions by the objecting lawyer or an unrepresented party, which results in a hearing and re-examination of the evidence by the judge.
