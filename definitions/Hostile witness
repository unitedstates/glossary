A witness (also called adverse witness) whose relationship to the opposing party is such that his testimony may be prejudiced; instead of testifying for the party that called him, he testifies against such party; a witness declared to be hostile may be asked leading questions and is subject to cross-examination by the party that called him as if he had been called by the other party.
