A pardon which frees the criminal without any condition whatever from reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offense and the guilt of the offender. It obliterates in legal contemplation of the offense itself. It restores the accused to his civil rights and remits the penalty imposed for the particular offense of which he was convicted in so far as it remains unpaid or unserved.
