A proceeding similar to a trial without a jury in which issues of fact or law are tried before a judge or magistrate or a referee and may include evidence and attorneys' arguments on the case; a hearing may be held at any state of the proceedings; there are also administrative hearings which may take place outside the judicial process, before officials who have been granted judicial authority expressly for the purpose of conducting such hearings.
