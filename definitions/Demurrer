A pleading by a defendant disputing the legal sufficiency of plaintiff's pleadings. In effect, it is an allegation that even if the plaintiff's claims are true, he has not stated a claim which is sufficient for the judge to enter an order in his favor for the requested award. It is used to try to get a case dismissed because the legal claims are not sufficient for granting judicial relief.
