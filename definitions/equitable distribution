The distribution of property between husband and wife in a divorce or annulment case. Each party receives so-called separate property outright, while marital property acquired during the marriage in which both parties have some legal rights or interests are divided between the parties based on the equities of the parties (what would be a fair distribution in light of contributions to the marriage, earning capacity, obligations, etc.).
