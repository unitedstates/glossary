After a bill is introduced, it is immediately sent to one or more committees for consideration and approval.

Every bill is referred to a committee, but few bills actually receive committee attention, so most bills die here. It's up to each committee to vote on whether the bill should be considered by the whole chamber.

Almost every bill will need a committee's approval to be considered by the whole chamber. On rare occasions, a bill can bypass the committee process and be brought directly to the floor.

Bills are referred to committees by subject area. For example, a bill about wind energy investment in the House might be referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee. If that bill involves taxes, it might also be referred to the House Appropriations Committee.
