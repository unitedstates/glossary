In legal proceedings, to object (e.g., to the admission of evidence, to a question, etc.) is to interpose a declaration to the effect that the particular matter or thing under consideration is not done or admitted with the consent of the party objecting, but is considered by that party improper or illegal, and referring the question of its propriety or legality to the court; the judge may sustain the objection, denying the admission of evidence, or question, etc., or he may overrule the objection, permitting the evidence or question, etc.
