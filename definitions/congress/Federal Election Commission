The independent regulatory agency that oversees the financing of federal elections.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) administers and enforces the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) with six commissioners appointed by the president and congressional leaders of the opposite party. The duties of the agency, as described by their website, are "to disclose campaign finance information, to enforce the provisions of the law such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions, and to oversee the public funding of Presidential elections."
