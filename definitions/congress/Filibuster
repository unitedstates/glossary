A technique or strategy used in the Senate to postpone or prevent a vote on a bill.

A filibuster attempts to delay business or block legislation in the U.S. Senate by continuous speeches, prolonged debate or other procedural actions on the floor. This obstructive and time-consuming parliamentary practice is used by Senators to defeat, modify or delay the vote on a bill, resolution, amendment or motion. Filibusters may also be employed to delay passage of -- "hold hostage" -- one bill, which may be urgently needed legislation, in order to force the Senate to act on another bill. Filibusters are effective only because Senate rules contain no motion by which a simple majority of Senators can end a debate. A vote can occur only once debate ends.

The term is derived from the Spanish term filibusteros ("freebooters"), mid-19th century military adventurers who fomented insurrections against various Latin American governments.
