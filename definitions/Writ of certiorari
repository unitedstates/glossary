An order by the appellate court which is used by that court when it has discretion on whether or not to hear an appeal from a lower court. If the writ is denied the court refuses to hear the appeal and, in effect, the judgment bellow stands unchanged. If the writ is granted, then it has the effect of ordering the lower court to certify the record and send it up to the higher court which has used its discretion to hear the appeal.
