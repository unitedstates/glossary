To supersede; to annul; to make void; to reject by subsequent action or decision; a judicial decision is said to be overruled when a later decision, rendered by the same court or by a higher court in the same judicial system, expresses a judgment upon the same question of law contrary to that which was given before, thereby depriving the earlier opinion of all authority as a precedent; also refers to a decision by a judge not to sustain or uphold a party's objection to the introduction of a particular evidence or to a specific question.
