Failure to exercise that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence (a reasonable person) would exercise under the same circumstances; in other words, failure to do something that a reasonable person would do; or the doing of something which a reasonable person would not do; it is usually an accidental act or omission which results in injury to another.
