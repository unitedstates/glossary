When two or more persons claim the same thing (or fund) of a third, and he, laying no claim to it himself, is ignorant which of them has right to it, and fears he may be prejudiced by their proceeding against him to recover it, he may join such claimants as defendants and require them to interplead their claims so that he may not be exposed to double or multiple liability.
