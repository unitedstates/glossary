This is a term often used, but not easily defined; it does not mean a mere possible doubt, because everything relating to human affairs and depending on moral evidence is open to some possible or imaginary doubt; it is that state of the case which, after a full comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors (or the mind of the judge, in court trials) in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge.
